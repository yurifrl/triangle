# History
A timeline of development considerations (there will be grammar errors)

- First thing i tought: that is to easy, so there migth be a trick there,
  or they expectations are super high, so a better do a great job
- Given the nature of the chalenge, i desided to create a lib/component
  that can be pluged in other projects, I belive all code should be like this,
  isolated, functional, whit no side efects
- The problem reminds me of a Jim Weirich Talk, where he did a roman numbers
  converter with ruby, and he explains a rather simple idea of TDD + refactoring
  that i find fitting for the job
- There is a few reasons why i chose elixir:
    1. Jim's examples is such a commom, that i saw it other time on a
       elixir workshop
    2. I found elixir pattern matching just wonderful for the job, i could use haskell
       but i could use the knowledge of the roman numbers example
    3. Elixir looks, cool. No. Seriously, look at it. It's functional, it's parallel
       it was built on top of erlang, it's inspired by ruby's syntax that's a very
       intuitive and easy to use
    4. Although i do not master it, i like it very much
    5. It's a Brazilian creation :D
    6. I want to master it so, noting better than coding on it, right?
- I use docker for everything, In a daily basis i use node, ruby, elixir
  somethimes i study algorithms in java, and tweak with go and haskell,
  And i don't have any of those instaled in my machine.
  For me that's amazing, i can just switch computers and simply clone the repo
  and it works, i have the same environment as my teammate and production,
  It's like having superpowers XD
- The new updated elixir image just donwloaded, so i will start the project
- I renamed the module to something short, Tc extends for Triangle Computation? maybe?
- I'm no good with names.
- Is not a good pratice to jumping writing code, but the completion requirements
  are well defined, so i don't believe it will be a problem, so i started writing tests
- The first test started with a list, and i looped the test values to the function
  but i desided not to get ahead of myself, and do step by step
- The first test if a very simple one, just to get a taste of the api
- Now i will google the Pythagorean Theorem because i do not remember it at all
